# Blog Builder Configuration

This crate provides the `Config` structure to the Blog Builder.

## Application

The `Config` structure reads in the `blog.toml` file in the root of the site.  It then may be passed to internal functions in the Blog Builder to control the configuration of site style, menus, and analytics.
