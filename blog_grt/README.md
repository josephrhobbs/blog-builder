# Blog Builder Getroot Utility

This crate provides the `getroot` function to the Blog Builder.

## Application

The `getroot` function is used by the Site Tree Manager (crate `blog_str`) to determine the root directory of this site.  This enables the user to call `blog` in any subdirectory of their site.
