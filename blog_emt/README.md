# Blog Builder Emitter

This crate provides the `Emitter` structure to the Blog Builder.

## Application

The `Emitter` structure emits as HTML _valid_ expressions generated by the parser.  The emitter should never try to emit a malformed expression (as generated by a parsing error) or it will panic.  The Parser Check Utility (crate `blog_chk`) should check for all malformed expressions before a list of expressions is passed to the emitter.
